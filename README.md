# Python-Morse-Code
Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots(.) and dashes(-). 

Before cell phones even before telephones, people communicated through Morse code. Despite being a technology that is over 160 years old, itâ€™s still used today among amateur radio users and on some ships. If you were in Boy Scouts, you might have messed around with Morse code or maybe you had a grandpa who used it on his ham radio. Learning Morse is a fun and engaging hobby you can share with gramps and an interesting man skill to possess.
